In conclusion the experiment, yileding a $p$-values of 0.02, seems to show that cultural values \emph{can} be infered from population reading activity. However, the $p$-value being computed by viewing the 21 classifiers as a whole merely confirms this possilibty: No single classifier was trained on enough samples to reach statistical significance.
The models inference is within 1 stanTdard deviation of the true value component average and distribution 95\% of the time. When doing per quarter prediction the perormance does drop, though whether this is due to unquantified chagnes in cultural states or model error can not be discovered with the current experimental setup.
